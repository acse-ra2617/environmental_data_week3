    "In this section you will read in a .png image which shows 4 geological units, one of them being a \"thin-wedge\". Geologically speaking, this wedge could be one side of a channel which pinches out to the left. Channels are important in geotechnical assessments as their physical properties may be quite different to the surrounding host rock/sediments. Channels often contain higher-porosity sediments and can be surrounded by mud over-bank deposits which are impermeable. This means channels can be reservoirs for fluids, including gas which could be a hazard in geotechnical works.\n",

However, for clastic sediments (eroded fragments of rock) that we are likely to find in areas of wind-turbine exploration the density and velocity are expected to increase with depth.

They are very useful in seismic interpretation because the highest amplitude part of the wavelet is reflected from horizons. Therefore, as a seismic interpreter you pick the peaks and troughs to establish the depth to horizons (rather than having to interpret parts of the wavelet with zero amplitude which would be the case for a minimum phase wavelet). During the seismic processing workflow a deconvolution step involves designing a filter which converts minimum phase wavelets into Ricker wavelets.

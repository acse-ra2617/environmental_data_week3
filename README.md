# environmental_data_week3
material for week 3 for the environmental data module (A. Lipp/rivers and B. Bell/seismology)


NB: the /data folder for "Seismic reflection imaging" was too big to pose on githup. You can access the data using the following Imperial File Exchange link: 


## Learning outcomes:

On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:
1.	Understand common data format and database structures specific to representative fields of environmental science 
2.	Demonstrate technical competency in handling common data types routinely encountered in the environmental sciences and identify relevant open-source data repositories
3.	Identify and design suitable data analysis strategies that consider data types, data distribution constraints, strength, benefits and limitations of statistical and modelling tools and environmental dynamics.
4.	Understand the limitation of available data and data analysis products. Understand sources of errors and demonstrate ability to comprehensively characterize uncertainties and interpret results in the context of these uncertainties, including measurement errors, environmental uncertainties as well as errors stemming from the analytical procedure itself (e.g. calibration of analysis using synthetic data/models). 


## Seismic reflection imaging - Tue 30th Nov and Thur 2nd Dec

## Description of contents:

This module will deliver the core knowledge and skills required for accessing, loading, viewing and analysing 3D post-stack seismic reflection data which provides images of the Earth's subsurface for environmental and geotechnical engineering purposes. In order for you to be able to make use of these data as data scientists we need to cover some geological and geophysical background. 

This week, we will focus on: 
1. The fundamentals of the seismic reflection method and how seismic reflection data is collected and processed
2. The standard data format for seismic reflection data (SEG-Y), how to access it and use it for environmental and geotechnical purposes
3. How data science and machine learning could revolutionise seismic studies

We won't be able to go through these topics in detail, but it is hoped that the material covered will give you enough information to inspire you as Environmental data scientists to the great potential of seismic data
